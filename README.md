# Tesselateral Mazes

Generate mazes out of any equilateral which tessellates the plane.

## Getting Started

Start by running `chmod +x make-venv.sh` and then `./make-venv.sh`. You'll only need to
do this on first setup, or each time you update to a new version which includes a new
virtual environment.

On a fresh terminal, run `source activate-venv.sh` to setup python packages. If you
want a jupyter lab session, run `jupyter lab`, and select the `localhost` link.
